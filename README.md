# MoneyControl

This a Java Program which i wrote in Java before the Android ManageXPence app so it has the same functionalities as the android app.

In detail a user can: 

Add expenses as they occur by entering the amount,the description and the date made. These three elements are saved in a file of the 
application. 

To view this file press on Report. They are also classified by month. 
You can add expenses occured between two dates for example 01/05/2016-15/05/2016, just remember to add the hyphen - symbol between the two dates. 

You can Edit an expense or delete one you do not need. To edit an expense search first for it by amount or by description. Then select it, press on the Edit an Expense button, make any changes needed and press Save. To delete it, select it and then press on the Delete an expense button. 

The charts button shows you three types of charts, a pie chart, a bar chart and a line chart. The first two charts are showing every month's expenses, the line chart shows all expenses by month so you can see which month you have spent more. 

You can export your expenses on a location of your computer and you can import them back. So you can make any changes on the file you have exported and then by pressing import you can pass these changes by importing the expenses file. 

Finally, you can enter your income and one graph will be displayed showing the balance (income-expenses made for the current month)
